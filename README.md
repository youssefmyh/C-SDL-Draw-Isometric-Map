# C-SDL-Draw-Isometric-Map

This project demonstrates how to render an isometric tile-based map using C++ and the SDL2 library. It provides a foundational framework for developers interested in creating isometric games or visualizations.

## Features

- **Isometric Map Rendering**: Displays a grid-based isometric map with smooth scrolling capabilities.
- **Tile Management**: Supports loading and rendering of various tile types to construct diverse terrains.
- **Event Handling**: Incorporates basic input handling to navigate and interact with the isometric map.

## Prerequisites

- C++11 or higher
- SDL2 library
- SDL2_image extension library

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssefmyh/C-SDL-Draw-Isometric-Map.git
   ```
   This command will download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Set Up the Development Environment**:
   - Ensure that the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries are installed on your system.
   - Configure your compiler to include the SDL2 headers and link against the SDL2 libraries.

3. **Build the Project**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Compile the source code using your preferred build system or IDE.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the compiled binary to launch the isometric map renderer.
   - Use the provided input controls to navigate and interact with the map.

## Project Structure

- `SDLTest/`: Contains the main application code and resources.
- `SDLTest.xcodeproj/`: Xcode project files for macOS users.
- `assets/`: Directory for storing tile images and other assets.
- `src/`: Source code files implementing the isometric rendering and game logic.
- `README.md`: This readme file.
- `screen.jpg`: Screenshot showcasing the rendered isometric map.

## How It Works

The application initializes the SDL2 library and creates a window for rendering. It loads tile images from the `assets/` directory and arranges them in an isometric grid. The rendering loop handles user input for navigation and updates the display accordingly. The `src/` directory contains the core logic for rendering and managing the isometric map.
